# Vineyard Spacing Calculator
A Java-based utility designed to calculate the maximum number of grapevines that can 
fit in a single row based on specific vineyard dimensions and assembly constraints.

# Features
- Calculates usable planting space by accounting for end-post assembly requirements.
- Determines vine density based on user-defined spacing.
- Includes basic error handling for insufficient row length.
# The Formula
- The application utilizes the following calculation:\(V=\frac{R-2E}{S}\)
- Where:V: Number of grapevines.
- R: Length of the row (in feet).
- E: Amount of space used by an end-post assembly.
- S: Space between vines.

# Compiling
- IF you want to run this program
- Ensure you have Java JDK installed

# Technologies
Language: Java 8+
Standard Library: java.util.Scanner for user input.
